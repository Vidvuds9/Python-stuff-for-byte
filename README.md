# Python-stuff
this is a repository of my python programs


Main.py

Main.py is my first python program, so be advised of messy code XD



IDK.exe

Please be aware that the idk.exe file is seen by antiviruses as malware, but you can rest assured that it's not. The main.py is the same exact code.



Main.pyw

Main.pyw is a python file but you can only see the code using python's ide.
